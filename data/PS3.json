As the title suggests, a large portion of the game consists of stealth, staking out targets and firing sniper rifles. Bullet trajectories are subject to wind, gravity and flight time, all of which players must account for when taking shots. To simplify this procedure, easier difficulty settings contain indicators that highlight enemies and show precisely where a bullet will hit.\n\nThe main weapons used in the game are silenced pistols, knives and various types of sniper rifles. In missions that are played with characters who are not snipers, the stealth aspect is dropped in favor of faster-paced \"run and gun\" scenarios. An exception to this are spotting missions, in which the primary objective consists of marking targets for a computer-controlled sniper character.\n\nMost of the game takes place in a dense jungle environment. Waypoint overlays at all times display the correct routes through the areas players must traverse. While these routes need not be followed exactly, the level design usually ensures an overall linear path due to obstacle placement and invisible walls. Many waypoints trigger scripted mission events, and some waypoints act as checkpoints, which automatically save the game.\n\nThe single player campaign of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is made up of four separate acts, each of which deals with a different conflict. All acts are split up into various missions, which usually depict the same event from different points of view. For example, in one segment players may be participating in an infantry assault on an enemy camp, while the next segment has them assuming the role of a supporting sniper who backs up the assault. There is downloadable content available for the title that seamlessly continues the story line with three additional campaign missions."},{"id":"290","name":"Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2","year":"2013","genre":"Shooter, Tactical","rating_ign":"61","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co39uv.jpg","description":"Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform, first-person, modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game."},{"id":"479","name":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith","year":"2008","genre":"Music","rating_ign":"71","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co53lc.jpg","description":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith puts the player in the shoes of \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\" as they evolve from unknowns to rock superstars.

The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 on March 29, 2009 and on PlayStation 2 on April 14, 2009, with an Australian and European release in May 2009. Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.\n\nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc.\n\nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience."},{"id":"481","name":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen","year":"2009","genre":"Music","rating_ign":"60","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1wqg.jpg","description":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen lets you stand in the shoes of this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band as you perform 25 epic Van Halen tracks, three signature Eddie Van Halen solos and 19 guest act tracks.

The game is structurally similar to Guitar Hero 5, and supports full band play (lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals) including the drop-in/drop-out and in-song instrument and difficulty change menus, and additional multiplayer modes as Guitar Hero 5. The console versions use instrument-shaped game controllers, while the DS version uses either the \"Guitar Grip\" introduced with the Guitar Hero: On Tour series or a new Drum Skin that comes with the game. Like previous games, virtual avatars of Taylor Swift, Adam Levine, and the band No Doubt are presented in the game.\n\nBand Hero received mixed reviews from journalists. Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form. A day after the game's release, the band No Doubt sued Activision, citing similar misuse of their avatars as the Kurt Cobain avatar in Guitar Hero 5."},{"id":"484","name":"DJ Hero","year":"2009","genre":"Music","rating_ign":"79","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co8ri1.jpg","description":"DJ Hero primarily simulates turntablism, a musical style used by disc jockeys to create a new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero's Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.\n\nA single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\"DJ vs DJ\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time."},{"id":"485","name":"DJ Hero 2","year":"2010","genre":"Music","rating_ign":"81","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co2e2t.jpg","description":"The follow up to the award-winning #1 new videogame IP of 2009, DJ Hero 2 will transform living rooms into nightclubs all over again with an entirely new music-gaming experience.

Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers."},{"id":"551","name":"Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams","year":"2012","genre":"Platform, Puzzle, Adventure, Indie","rating_ign":"77","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co2iqi.jpg","description":"Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a blistering hardcore platformer with contrasting worlds.

Like in Snatcher, the game features shooting segments where the player must defend their character from incoming enemies.

The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player.

Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.\n\nOn the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play.

One of its highlights is the use of Euphoria, a game animation engine that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \"one of its silver linings\". NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010.\n\nBackbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. After the reviews, the passing game was adjusted by the greathouse patch. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade.

It is the third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions in 1998. The PC version of the game was released November 30, 1998 and a PlayStation version was later developed and released on April 2, 1999.\n\nUnlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.\n\nPopulous: The Beginning was the first entry in the series to use true 3D computer graphics; Bullfrog waited four years after Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods so that the graphics technology could catch up to their vision for a new and different game in the series. The developers considered the addition of terrain deformation and manipulation, combined with \"smart\" villagers who automatically attended to tasks, to add an entirely new dimension to the series. The game's original title was Populous: The Third Coming before being changed prior to the beta release.\nPopulous: The Beginning plays very differently from earlier titles and received mixed reviews. Reviewers positively noted the excellent graphics, while complaints were directed at the artificial intelligence and the indecision in game design between being a real time strategy title and a god game. GamePro's Peter Olafson wrote that Populous: The Beginning was not a bad game, in fact a good one; \"but it's a different game—one without a quintessential quality that defined Populous.\""},{"id":"850","name":"Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments","year":"2014","genre":"Puzzle, Adventure","rating_ign":"79","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1sqz.jpg","description":"Crimes & Punishments lets you become the greatest detective of all time, Sherlock Holmes!

Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting, firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more \"outdoorsy sportsman\" and camping aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles.\n\nThere are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are \"attending\" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are \"blamed\" on the character.\n\nEvents in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more \"unusual\" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called \"Bear-Hunter-Ninja\" and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players.

Wild animals such as bears, wolves, cougars and even birds threaten survival, and require the pilot to dredge up any hunting and survival skills he has.\n\nThe game is designed to be compatible with the Top Shot Elite gun peripheral, and as such, there is a targeting cursor onscreen that the player uses to hunt or even use some equipment, with all the aiming done manually with the Top Shot Elite. With a controller, the targeting cursor is controlled in a manner similar to a Third-Person Shooter. The player has the ability to perform \"Focus Shots\" which slow down time and allow for visible placement of internal organs of the animal being hunted or defended against."},{"id":"942","name":"Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle","year":"2012","genre":"Puzzle, Adventure","rating_ign":"50","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co8ibp.jpg","description":"Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle is a pirate themed adventure game about a girl who goes on a quest to find the legendary \"Golden Turtle\".

This installment still features the same storyline based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with the various officers as playable characters. The character list and appearance is the same as in Dynasty Warriors 6, meaning some of the previous game's characters are not available.\n\nThe difference in this one is that the player is allowed to choose only one character for the chosen force (either Wei, Wu or Shu) who starts in a village that will act as the hub, or camp, from which the game battles are accessed. By completing story missions, some characters are added and can be played as without starting a new game, meaning all acquired weapons, items and materials will be kept.\n\nThe chosen character can be customized in various ways. Apart from the main weapon, one sub weapon, chosen from many weapon types, can be equipped. Both weapons can be switched anytime during battle, to accommodate the situation. A new addition is the Chi system which allows to set special abilities to the character, there are four slots to equip Chi (the two arms and legs). Weapons can also be customized by adding Orbs that give different abilities, such as elemental properties.\n\nIn the village, the player can exchange materials, buy weaponry, items for use in battle, Chi skills and Orbs. Some NPC's may appear in the village, some giving materials or items, or Officer cards, which can be set to help the Village's growth. Over time, better items can be acquired from the shops.\n\nBy talking to the quest board or the Guard at the village's gate, main Missions or Requests can be chosen. Each battle is a series of small maps where various enemy soldiers and weaponry are fought, eventually leading to the commander of the enemy army. The goal of each battle can vary, some are classic goals like \"Defeat the Commander\" and some, less battle oriented, like \"Retrieve all treasure boxes\". In addition, there also are bonus missions that require the player to defeat a particular unit, reaching a certain point before a certain time, etc. Each bonus mission gives extra experience points upon completion.\n\nOther new additions to the battle system are the possibility to have aerial battles, and the main feature of the game: the Fury Mode, unleashed when the Fury gauge (replacing the traditional Musou gauge) is full. The furied character has better stats and move sets, and can unleash the infamous Musou attack to deal some extra damage.\n\nTo add to the surreal look of the game, some new bosses are actually massive beast-like weapons, and usually require the help of other players to defeat them. Multiplayer mode is available only via AdHoc connection, and can connect up to four players."},{"id":"997","name":"EA Sports MMA","year":"2010","genre":"Fighting, Sport","rating_ign":"78","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co60jx.jpg","description":"EA SPORTS MMA brings the authenticity of the world’s most intense combat sport home like never before.

The players control spaceships to freely roam the space and attack Nazi vessels; various weapons and equipment are at their disposal, from laser cannons and missiles to handy drones and satellites which can be launched from certain ships. The vessels are also equipped with military countermeasures, to protect them from enemy fire.\n\nThe players can access a tactical map of outer space to spot the positions of Nazi forces or any ongoing battles, and thus instantly know where to fly. The ultimate goal is to destroy the secret Nazi base hidden on the Dark Side of the Moon and to keep the Earth safe from the invading spacecraft.\n\nBeing based on the cult movie, the “Iron Sky: Invasion” comes with a touch of politics as well: various nations will offer unique missions, yet to accept or refuse them is up to the player. Some missions tempt the players with special rewards, such as precious upgrades or even brand new ships.\n\nThe players can dock at an allied space station to recharge weapons, purchase upgrades or even switch ships. Almost all spaceships that appear in the film can be controlled in game (except for the largest one), including the South-Korean scout ship “Zerg”, the Australian bomber “Dundee”, or the UK fighter “Spitfire”. The availability of some will depend on the completion of certain missions.\n\nThe ships’ sub-systems can be further upgrade in the hangar: for example, upgrading the offensive systems will increase the number of weapons and boost their power, while an engine upgrade will improve the ship’s speed and range of interception.

With gameplay more akin to European-style \"Soccer Manager\" games than the Madden NFL franchise from which it spawned, the original NFL Head Coach generally received lukewarm reviews from critics. But after a one-year hiatus -- during which it presumably did a little TV and work spent some quality time with the family -- the franchise returns with a new focus on depth and realism. Once again the coach's livelihood depends on his approval rating, and everything gamers do, from win/loss record, to going for it on fourth down, to choosing whether to yell at the QB after a bad interception, will affect approval rating.\n\nKey personnel decisions have been given an added sense of urgency with the new Live Event feature, which puts all trade, free agency, coaching, and contract negotiations up against a running timer. As in real life, the draft is the centerpiece of the NFL offseason, and gamers can prepare by scouting players in college all-star games, at the NFL combine, and during pro-day and individual workouts. Meanwhile, players can get running commentary on the lives and college careers of more than 20,000 unique draft prospects from NFL Network personality Adam Schefter. Other additions intended to increase realism include: Non-drafted free agent rookies, 75-man preseason rosters, trades involving future draft picks, a new wear and tear injury system, and 300 new sideline animations.\n\nNFL Head Coach 09's online features allow gamers to upload created plays and download, rate, or view any play available. Two players can also go head-to-head in a quick test of coaching acumen. Offline, gamers can adjust their plays in the middle of a game and save the new formations, or create entire playbooks using the coach clipboard user interface. All created plays can then be exported and used in Madden NFL 09. ~ Christopher Brown, All Game Guide"},{"id":"1065","name":"NFL Tour","year":"2008","genre":"Sport","rating_ign":"75","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/hkrwama5w8mayrxdmk4r.jpg","description":"NFL Tour is an arcade football video game.

Depending on the choices made by the player and the influence of the demon, some chapters will offer different scenarios and a different experience. Bound by Flame also includes a crafting system, allowing them to create and improve equipment, including their armor and weapons. Several companions will join the player during his quest, and will, depending on the player's actions, develop friendship, romance or rivalry. Also, using the crafting, you can customize your weapons and armour with more depth than most other games. for example, you can change the blade and hilt of your sword separately, which not only changes its appearance, but will also change its attributes e.g., + 4 crit, + 3 speed. When fighting enemies, you can use three different fighting styles: one uses slow, heavy, damaging strikes with weapons like axes and hammers, and a push/ kick ability to interrupt enemies or break their defences; another uses small weapons like daggers for quick strikes, and gives you a dodge ability to evade enemy attacks. The third style uses fire attacks for big damage, and can be combined with the other two fighting styles to do things like enhancing weapons with fire damage. Each of the three styles has its own skill tree with both passive and active abilities. During combat, you can use other attacks aside from striking with your weapon, like a crossbow, traps, and abilities you've earned from the skill trees."},{"id":"1101","name":"Test Drive Unlimited 2","year":"2011","genre":"Racing","rating_ign":"68","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co61vw.jpg","description":"Test Drive Unlimited 2 (abbreviated as TDU2) is an open world racing video game developed by Eden Games and published by Atari.

Sailing (planned for the first game, but never released) is possible in this game, albeit in only a few locations.\n\nFeats and skills can be learned to enhance each form of combat. Learned spells can be combined with each other using the new card modifiers to enhance or change their effects.

The Amahagane are sacred jewels which grant the owners godlike powers, such as Kamui. Now, rumors are spreading of new, ungodly creatures fighting with Heishi warriors, even without the powers of Amahagane. Yoshitsune and his companions must draw their weapons again, and with the new strength given to them by the Amahagane, defeat the new evil to save all of Japan.\n\nGenji: Days of the Blade, sequel to the PlayStation 2 game Genji: Dawn of the Samurai, is an action game, based in ancient/feudal Japan, in which you must defeat a new, mysterious source of evil to save your country. You control one of four characters (changeable in real-time), each with their own weapons, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nYoshitsune Minamoto and Benkei Musashibo, the main characters of the previous game, join with Gozen Shizuka and Lord Buson to complete their quest. Yoshitsune is a young warrior who wields a katana in each hand, Benkei is a mighty warrior-monk who uses a war club and a naginata for weapons. Shizuka is a nimble priestess who is adept with chained blades, and Buson is a God of War from the Overworld who carries a double saber and can use supernatural powers.\n\nThe game play involves fighting many enemies and bosses with regular attacks, combo attacks, and Kamui. Kamui is a power that you can use to summon a magical space around you in which you unleash multiple special attacks on surrounding enemies by pressing buttons in series as they appear on the screen. Your Kamui bar fills as you land successful hits on opponents. The characters travel through both levels based on real locations in Japan and fantasy locations, defeating everything from regular Heishi warriors to giant, mutated enemy crabs. The level design involves platformer elements and solving small puzzles, such as destroying Masho flowers scattered throughout an area to open a door.\n\nThe game also has RPG elements; you collect Amahagane and Mashogane hidden around levels and from fallen enemies. They can be used to augment character stats and weapon attack power, respectively. You can also find new weapons and items such as herbs with healing properties, or scrolls that give you attack bonuses for a period of time."},{"id":"1155","name":"Gran Turismo 6","year":"2013","genre":"Racing, Simulator, Sport","rating_ign":"81","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co3wi4.jpg","description":"Gran Turismo 6 is a racing video game and the sixth main installment—and twelfth overall entry—in the Gran Turismo series.\n\nNew features include the addition of more cars and tracks, enhanced car customization options, and partnerships with the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Ayrton Senna Institute, the FIA, and NASA."},{"id":"1156","name":"Haze","year":"2008","genre":"Shooter","rating_ign":"64","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co28oe.jpg","description":"Haze is a first-person shooter video game developed by Free Radical Design and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 3.

The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.\n\nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.\n\nWhen dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.\n\nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.\n\nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons."},{"id":"1402","name":"All Zombies Must Die!","year":"2011","genre":"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG), Arcade","rating_ign":"65","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co4v75.jpg","description":"Reload your shotgun, sharpen your sword and rev that chainsaw; Deadhill town is teeming with zombies, and it’s your job to put ‘em down!

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.\nThe game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.\nSince its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\"."},{"id":"1476","name":"Destiny: The Taken King","year":"2015","genre":"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","rating_ign":"78","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1z9q.jpg","description":"Destiny: The Taken King - Legendary Edition is perfect for new and existing Guardians that are ready to jump into the Destiny universe or continue to carve their legend in the stars.

As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen's past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds.\n\nIn Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat.\n\nControl can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy.\n\nWhen in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen's back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms.\n\nDefeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy.\n\nWhile Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much.\n\nWhen in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen's demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so.\n\nScree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen's powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances.\n\nThe player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree's energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree.\n\nIf Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree's reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen's health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over.\n\nThroughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene."},{"id":"1525","name":"The Last of Us: Left Behind","year":"2014","genre":"Shooter, Adventure","rating_ign":"84","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co5xg8.jpg","description":"Left Behind is the first single player DLC for the critically acclaimed survival horror game The Last of Us, developed by Naughty Dog."},{"id":"1526","name":"Muv-Luv Photonflowers*","year":"2014","genre":"Adventure, Visual Novel","rating_ign":"70","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co3pgl.jpg","description":"Muv-Luv Photonflowers* is one of two side-story collections in the Muv-Luv series of visual novels released in 2014, the other being Photonmelodies♮."},{"id":"1527","name":"Sword Art Online: Lost Song","year":"2015","genre":"Role-playing (RPG)","rating_ign":"73","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co79mw.jpg","description":"Journey into the world of Alfheim Online for the very first time!

Another version of the legend is: EA set Bullfrog under pressure to release Dungeon Keeper or Magic Carpet 2 - but they weren't able to. So they released Hi-Octane, a quickly done game.\n\nIn a Gamasutra article it was mentioned that \"PC and Saturn racing game Hi-Octane, was developed in just eight weeks using the Magic Carpet engine, as a way to “fill a quarter that didn't have enough revenue”."},{"id":"1534","name":"Sim Theme Park","year":"1999","genre":"Simulator, Strategy","rating_ign":"65","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/coa3h5.jpg","description":"Like the previous title, Theme Park World tasks players with managing a series of amusement parks.

Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team. The actual fights, however, are one-on-one fights, with the partner only participating by being called in when a player has enough 'vigor' for a Team Up attack, done by pressing a punch and kick button of the same pressure. The Team Ups would be some kind of double team attack by the character and partner, or (for most female characters' Team Ups) would heal the main character or give them more vigor. After the end of a round, a player (win or lose) has a choice to fight the next round with the partner from the previous round, or to keep their main character in play. The 'vigor' meter (essentially a super meter) could go up to 9 levels, with Team Ups costing two levels and super moves from a single person all costing one level of vigor. Much like the Marvel vs. Capcom games, launchers can be done that allow air combos to be performed, with all characters having universal low and high launchers.\n\nThe game also had a few defensive techniques.\n\nTardy Counters acted much like Alpha Counters from Street Fighter Alpha, allowing a player to immediately counter-attack from a blocking position. However, the restrictions on Tardy Counters are very lax; any hard normal, special or super attack can be used to Tardy counter (Alpha counters are only limited to certain special moves for each character), and Tardy Counters do not cost any extra vigor to perform (Alpha Counters required at least a level of Super Combo gauge to do).\n\nAttack Cancels allowed a player to cancel an incoming hit simply by timing their own hit with the attack, which would cancel out both attacks (though it does not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit move). Also, one additional level of vigor is awarded."},{"id":"1543","name":"Shatter","year":"2009","genre":"Puzzle, Indie, Arcade","rating_ign":"76","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co2cdw.jpg","description":"Shatter is a retro-inspired brick-breaking game that merges familiar action with unique twists and a modern crafted production approach.

The game was followed by a PlayStation 2 sequel, a reimagining for the PlayStation 3 and a film adaption.\n\nSiren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \"Link Navigator\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called \"Shibito\", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.\n\nThere are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power named \"sightjack,\" which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they can recover after some time has passed. Characters will lose stamina during combat and while running."},{"id":"1585","name":"Helldivers","year":"2015","genre":"Shooter","rating_ign":"74","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1mo3.jpg","description":"Helldivers is a topdown shooter set in a satirical dystopian future where mankind is ruled by a managed democracy.

During development, the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from FFXI while creating something that stood on its own. Due to several factors, the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game. Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live.\n\nAfter its alpha test and a delayed beta test, the game went live on September 30, 2010, remaining active until its servers were closed on November 11, 2012. At launch, the game received a mixed to negative reaction: while the graphics and music met with general praise, other aspects were unanimously panned, including the gameplay, interface, and the general impression of the game being unfinished at launch.\n\nCritic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to pull subscription fees, indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and eventually develop an entirely new version of the game called FINAL FANTASY XIV ONLINE: A REALM REBORN.

Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the game's world of Fa'Diel according to his or her desires, a system which was incorporated through the use of \"artifacts,\" which are gained as the player progresses through the game. The player uses the artifacts to create different towns, dungeons, etc., called \"Lands\", to venture to and explore. This creates a non-linear gameplay, since the game is driven by a series of what would be considered side-quests in other games. Legend of Mana features three different plots which can occur simultaneously, and which do not necessarily need to be completed for the player to finish the game.\n\nLegend of Mana was a financial success in Japan.

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\n\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers.\n\nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die.

In the game based on the book and movie, you go from humble beginnings of petty crime and rise to be the most powerful crime lord in all of New York. The Godfather features customizable characters and a persistent gameworld, where your decisions affect how other characters interact with you. Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Robert Duvall return to the franchise to voice characters in the game as well.\n\nThe Don's Edition features a more basic form of the gesture-based BlackHand control scheme seen in the Wii version. The game uses the SIXAXIS' motion sensor functionality in interrogations and, to a limited degree, during melee combat. As in the Wii, if the player wishes to lift someone from their knees, they simply pull the controller upwards. Swinging the controller from side to side swings the enemy likewise. Slamming someone against a wall is accomplished by pushing the controller away from the player. Unlike in the Wii version, however, where shooting and driving were handled using the Wii Remote, in The Don's Edition, shooting and driving are controlled using the analog sticks.\n\nUnique to The Don's Edition are the \"Corleone challenges\". These are time based minigames that have no effect on the story. The player must see how much of a certain action they can accomplish in a given time - such as how many different execution styles they can perform, how many banks they can rob, or many businesses they can extort etc. When the game first came out, the player's scores were uploaded to an online leaderboard."},{"id":"1907","name":"Trash Panic","year":"2009","genre":"Puzzle","rating_ign":"80","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co3jcg.jpg","description":"Trash Panic is a puzzle game that has been compared to Tetris in terms of gameplay.

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business."},{"id":"1919","name":"Ōkami HD","year":"2012","genre":"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure","rating_ign":"87","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co22s8.jpg","description":"Experience the critically acclaimed masterpiece with its renowned Sumi-e ink art style in breathtaking high resolution.

It's a game that almost everyone has heard of, but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future. Unlike Sonic Adventure or the arcade hit Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio HD is the chance for many to finally play a game they've only heard about.\n\nNostalgia has the side effect of high expectations though, and Jet Set Radio HD just can't meet them. While the flash and style of Jet Set Radio HD remains untouched and unvarnished by a dozen years of progress, the rest of it can't stand up to scrutiny. Squirrely controls, camera catastrophes, and nonsensical level design make Jet Set Radio HD a better memory than game."},{"id":"1960","name":"Labyrinth Legends","year":"2012","genre":"Role-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Arcade","rating_ign":"69","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co3032.jpg","description":"Cartoony dungeon crawler with puzzle elements for the PS3."},{"id":"1961","name":"Germinator","year":"2013","genre":"Puzzle, Strategy","rating_ign":"80","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co60r3.jpg","description":"Something messy and contagious is festering in suburbia..."},{"id":"1962","name":"DmC: Devil May Cry - Vergil's Downfall","year":"2013","genre":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure","rating_ign":"74","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co425x.jpg","description":"Aside from playing as Vergil throughout the content, Vergil's Downfall features additional hidden items to collect, two new enemies and a new boss, and has a leaderboard with which to compete with others.

War, death, and bedlam have taken hold of civilisation. Humankind is at the brink of extinction. Those who aren't yet infected--the resistance, a band of mercenaries, soldiers and civilians--are Earth's final hope, and they have one goal in common: To stop the deadly infection and destroy the core of all evil, hidden in the depths of Conceyta. Scouts have undertaken a merciless mission to bring detailed plans and data on the location of the power and its defence line in a last attempt to save humankind. So it has come to be that the last remaining pilot, a mercenary and bounty hunter, is the only chance of survival, ironically driven by the desire for wealth and fame. Left with little choice, the resistance has developed a star fighter capable of intercepting the evil force, equipped with a deadly weapon system and of utmost agility.

The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge."},{"id":"2087","name":"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix","year":"2006","genre":"Racing","rating_ign":"71","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1hgi.jpg","description":"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition is a racing game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games It is the third installment in the Midnight Club series.

The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits. In the Famicom version, choosing another multiple after four will make the four multiples to move around the spacecraft for 16 seconds; force field is the only shielding available for protection of the entire spacecraft, withstanding three hits and it is included in four different weapon configurations and progressions; and 'Double' and 'Laser' have to be activated twice to achieve full performance."},{"id":"2253","name":"Metal Gear Solid: Integral","year":"1999","genre":"Shooter, Tactical, Adventure","rating_ign":"89","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co5e0f.jpg","description":"Metal Gear Solid: Integral is an expanded version of the original game.

The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.\n\nWhile the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a \"bubble shooter\", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.\n\nBubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.\n\nBust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series.

Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.\n\nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.\n\nIn addition to the original full game, L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition for PC will include a multi-use code to access all the previously released downloadable content from the console versions, including the “Nicholson Electroplating” Arson case, the “Reefer Madness” Vice case, “The Consul’s Car” Traffic case, “The Naked City” Vice case and “A Slip of the Tongue” Traffic case."},{"id":"2308","name":"Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond","year":"2010","genre":"Shooter, Platform","rating_ign":"64","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co5hwi.jpg","description":"Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond is designed as a 2D side scroller in order to give it a retro feel.
