Your ship moves between mission areas via \"hyperspace portals\", passing through a hyper-space environment, resembling that seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often during hyperspace transit, varying streams of energy are encountered - yellow energy replenishing the energy which fuels the ship, while blue energy drains it, reducing the ship's effectiveness.\n\nAfter you complete the four campaigns and destroy the Ovon home-world for the Reptons, they reward you by sending their best pilots to kill you in an honorable way (after all, they don't need a human in their society and war history).

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.\n\nLike Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris \"The Bear\" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.\n\nThroughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word \"RUMBLE\" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called \"Rumble Flurry\", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.\n\nOne unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game"},{"id":"232","name":"San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing","year":"1996","genre":"Racing","rating_ign":"72","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co2fs8.jpg","description":"San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing is the first game in the Rush series.\nTne N64 version contains six regular tracks and two hidden tracks.

Originally released in 1998 for the PlayStation, the game follows Sir Daniel Fortesque, a skeletal knight accidentally resurrected to battle the sorcerer Zarok and save the kingdom of Gallowmere.\n\nThe game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a legendary hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the game's true ending is revealed."},{"id":"257","name":"MediEvil II","year":"2000","genre":"Platform, Puzzle, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure","rating_ign":"79","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1tji.jpg","description":"MediEvil II is an action-adventure game developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.

Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team. The actual fights, however, are one-on-one fights, with the partner only participating by being called in when a player has enough 'vigor' for a Team Up attack, done by pressing a punch and kick button of the same pressure. The Team Ups would be some kind of double team attack by the character and partner, or (for most female characters' Team Ups) would heal the main character or give them more vigor. After the end of a round, a player (win or lose) has a choice to fight the next round with the partner from the previous round, or to keep their main character in play. The 'vigor' meter (essentially a super meter) could go up to 9 levels, with Team Ups costing two levels and super moves from a single person all costing one level of vigor. Much like the Marvel vs. Capcom games, launchers can be done that allow air combos to be performed, with all characters having universal low and high launchers.\n\nThe game also had a few defensive techniques.\n\nTardy Counters acted much like Alpha Counters from Street Fighter Alpha, allowing a player to immediately counter-attack from a blocking position. However, the restrictions on Tardy Counters are very lax; any hard normal, special or super attack can be used to Tardy counter (Alpha counters are only limited to certain special moves for each character), and Tardy Counters do not cost any extra vigor to perform (Alpha Counters required at least a level of Super Combo gauge to do).\n\nAttack Cancels allowed a player to cancel an incoming hit simply by timing their own hit with the attack, which would cancel out both attacks (though it does not nullify the remaining hits of a multi-hit move). Also, one additional level of vigor is awarded."},{"id":"493","name":"Gallop Racer","year":"1999","genre":"Racing, Simulator, Sport","rating_ign":"40","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co8l3p.jpg","description":"Gallop Racer (known as \"Gallop Racer 3: One and Only Road to Victory\" in Japan) is part horse racing simulation, part action/arcade racer.\n\nWhen choosing horses for your stable, you have to take a lot of factors into account.

Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors.\n\nAs a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities.\n\nArmed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.\n\nIn Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors."},{"id":"706","name":"Action Man: Operation Extreme","year":"2000","genre":"Shooter","rating_ign":"50","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co290c.jpg","description":"Action Man: Operation Extreme features two different gameplay modes that you switch back and forth from during the course of play.

One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.\n\nBubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.\n\nBust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor."},{"id":"775","name":"Street Fighter EX2 Plus","year":"1999","genre":"Fighting","rating_ign":"69","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co2oyi.jpg","description":"Conquering the World of 3-D Fighters!\n\nCapcom’s all-time, leading fighting flagship series once again goes 3-D with Street Fighter EX2 Plus, the sequel to the top-selling Street Fighter EX Plus for the PlayStation game console.

Critics noted a weak storyline, though GameSpot dismissed this is as unimportant in an action game.
