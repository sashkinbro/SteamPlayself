The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage."},{"id":"162","name":"Metal Slug 4","year":"2002","genre":"Shooter, Adventure, Arcade","rating_ign":"79","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1ox7.jpg","description":"One year after the events of Metal Slug 3, the world is trembling under the new threat of a mysterious but deadly cyber virus that threatens to attack and destroy any nation's military computer system.

Playboy: The Mansion is a social strategy game that calls on players to build a virtual empire of wealth, celebrity, and freedom from puritanical repression and intolerance. This is accomplished by developing a fully functioning Playboy mansion, to attract and accommodate influential celebrities and beautiful young models who are willing to strike the right poses. Players who can build a suitably entertaining and well-equipped mansion, while adhering to \"the Playboy philosophy,\" are rewarded with \"the Playboy lifestyle,\" surrounded by powerful trendsetters, influential pop idols, and sexually liberated young women. In short, the game invites players to take the role of a virtual Hugh Hefner.\n\nAs Hef, players will be responsible for keeping the Playboy brand relevant to its ever-evolving audience. One good way to do this is by attracting celebrity friends to the mansion, and making sure they have a good time when they visit. With enough money, players can build new facilities -- like swimming pools, movie theaters, or tennis courts -- which may have special appeal to particular celebrities. It's also a good idea to introduce these V.I.P. guests to Playmates who share their interests. The game's main interface should be familiar to Sims 2 players; characters are directed through their 3D domestic environments with mouse clicks, and clicked objects offer pop-up menus of available interactions.\n\nCoaxing powerful celebrity friends to appear in an issue of Playboy magazine can boost circulation, bringing in more income for future developments. As Hef, players can determine the content of each issue, choosing the articles, essays, cover shots, and centerfolds. They'll also have an opportunity to direct the photo shoots, choosing the location on the mansion grounds, the model, and the wardrobe selection -- all of which feature a \"topless\" option. The game includes a structured campaign that follows Hefner's real-life rise to international celebrity through a series of individual scenarios that focus on building the fame, circulation, and clout it took to develop the Playboy brand into what it is today. Players design their own challenges in the \"Empire\" mode, where they can set their own goals and victory conditions."},{"id":"246","name":"Shadow of the Colossus","year":"2005","genre":"Platform, Puzzle, Adventure","rating_ign":"88","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1ozz.jpg","description":"An open-world action/adventure game in which a young wanderer, along with a stolen magical sword and his steed companion, trespasses a cursed land, makes a deal with an ancient being to bring a sacrificial victim back to life, and sets off to fulfill his end of the bargain, which involves tracking down and infiltrating the abodes of sixteen colossi and sacrificing them to achieve his goal."},{"id":"247","name":"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2","year":"2006","genre":"Fighting","rating_ign":"79","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1u7c.jpg","description":"Tenkaichi 2 is a fighting game with more than 120 playable characters, the biggest amount ever featured in a Dragon Ball game.

These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.\nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\".\nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events.\nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them.\nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player.\nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live."},{"id":"263","name":"Zoocube","year":"2002","genre":"Puzzle","rating_ign":"56","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co6pn0.jpg","description":"Created by PuzzleKings, ZooCube takes puzzlers to a whole new dimension - the third dimension.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.\n\nGuitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.\n\nThe game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game."},{"id":"278","name":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith","year":"2008","genre":"Music","rating_ign":"71","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co53lc.jpg","description":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith puts the player in the shoes of \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\" as they evolve from unknowns to rock superstars.

Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.\n\nThe game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc.\n\nGuitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience."},{"id":"280","name":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen","year":"2009","genre":"Music","rating_ign":"60","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1wqg.jpg","description":"Guitar Hero: Van Halen lets you stand in the shoes of this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band as you perform 25 epic Van Halen tracks, three signature Eddie Van Halen solos and 19 guest act tracks.

Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the \"Top 40\" pop rock hits, while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers. They also contested the cost of the full game, featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5, and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form.

The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to Guitar Hero's Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.\n\nA single player career mode is available, as well both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes (\"DJ vs DJ\"), playable locally or remotely. Ten songs have been specially mixed to also support gameplay with Guitar Hero and other compatible guitar controllers in a \"DJ vs Guitar\" mode. Players can also use a microphone for a non-scoring addition to the mix. A Party Play mode allows the game to automatically play the songs with the ability for a player to jump in and play at any time."},{"id":"285","name":"LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game","year":"2005","genre":"Platform, Adventure","rating_ign":"77","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co4930.jpg","description":"LEGO Star Wars blends the unique world of LEGO with the adventure of Star Wars, for unforgettable action and fun.

Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world.\n\nEventually, plans of a nuclear reactor construction began to surface. China, South Korea, the Allied Nations and even the Russian Mafia sent troops to North Korea, competing for power in the troubled region.

Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.\n\nPlayers have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the \"Deck of 52\", a list of most wanted criminals in North Korea, as well as a number of factions. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck.\n\nPlayers have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done.

The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people.\n\nHaving escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok.\n\nTak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength.\n\nThe Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted.

This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller.

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.\n\nHis objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.\n\nAs the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the \"Hero's Handbook\" and Harry's off to adventure. The \"Hero's Handbook's\" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves."},{"id":"549","name":"The Polar Express","year":"2004","genre":"Racing, Adventure","rating_ign":"58","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1p2t.jpg","description":"An adventure game based on the CGI-animated Robert Zemeckis movie starring Tom Hanks and based on the children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.

It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes. Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform; though this ability comes rather late in the game."},{"id":"592","name":"ATV Quad Power Racing 2","year":"2003","genre":"Racing","rating_ign":"51","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/p6uxax4h9ocj0hjsepas.jpg","description":"ATV Quad Power Racing is the sequel to ATV Quad Power Racing on the Playstation, with many new features: Choose from 10 of the top professional riders from all over the world, including Dana Creech, Kory Ellis and Tim Farr.

In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills."},{"id":"626","name":"Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions","year":"2002","genre":"Racing, Arcade","rating_ign":"56","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1rx0.jpg","description":"Welcome to Hong Kong, where mystery and intrigue, money and power, and East and West intermingle.

The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower.

The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player.

It is the fifth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the second entry the Sonic Riders trilogy. A port for the Xbox 360 was cancelled during development, while a sequel, Sonic Free Riders, was released exclusively for that system in 2010.\n\nGameplay in Zero Gravity is largely similar to its predecessor, with characters racing on different types of hovercraft called \"Extreme Gear\". In addition to the mechanics from the previous game, Zero Gravity adds a new gameplay system based around gravity that replaces the predecessor's \"fuel\" system. During the race, performing tricks and other actions will increase a character's Gravity Points, or GP. If players have accrued enough GP by the time they enter certain areas of the track, they will enter a Zero-Gravity Zone, where they can perform one of two maneuvers. A Gravity Dive will create a small black hole that points gravity forward down the track, giving the player a powerful free-fall boost that is further augmented by striking objects in the vicinity that the hole displaces, such as cars or signs. Alternatively, Gravity Control will alter the gravity of the course, allowing players to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas and shortcuts. Players can also use Gravity Drift to more easily maneuver around sharp corners."},{"id":"748","name":"Space Chimps","year":"2008","genre":"Platform, Adventure","rating_ign":"60","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co5b6n.jpg","description":"Space Chimps is based off of the 2008 movie with the same name."},{"id":"749","name":"Speed Racer: The Videogame","year":"2008","genre":"Racing","rating_ign":"65","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co9234.jpg","description":"In Speed Racer, players take on the role of the characters from the film, getting behind the wheels of each character's signature vehicles to experience firsthand the film's high adrenaline, combative racing style.

Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses.

Players will explore five strange new lands that hold unimagined treasures for those brave and skilled enough to claim them. Battle and conquest are also important ingredients in a pirate's lifestyle and combat takes place both on land and on the high seas. The player's character is quick with a sword and can increase her swashbuckling skills with experience.\n\nSimilarly, wealth gained from adventure and victory allows the pirate to upgrade to larger ships with more deadly weaponry. A dozen unique fighting vessels will become available to skilled captains, along with special accoutrements that afford the ships extra powers. Sea battles involve a realistic combination of positioning and timing, as tall ships align themselves to fire on enemy vessels from port- and starboard-mounted weapons and time must be spent reloading the powerful cannons and guns after each shot. The ability to repair damage on the fly is also an important strategic consideration in ship-to-ship fights.\n\nThough the gameplay of this 3D adventure is oriented towards fast action, several elements of role-playing are also incorporated, to move the story along and involve the player more deeply. The lead character Katarina de Leon plots a thoughtful course for her career on the open seas. The \"Black Kat\" sets sail to uncover mysteries and position herself in circumstances that will increase her overall status among other pirates, securing a position of power. In addition to Katarina's well-developed storyline, the game's \"Captain vs. Captain\" battle mode allows a more combat-intensive, freeform style of play.\n\nPirates ?

Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration."},{"id":"939","name":"Tony Hawk's Project 8","year":"2006","genre":"Sport","rating_ign":"71","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1p3d.jpg","description":"Tony Hawk's Project 8, officially abbreviated as THP8, is a skateboarding video game, the eighth installment in the Tony Hawk's series.

At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.\n\nPlayers steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.\n\nThe world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack.

It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.\n\nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\n\nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\n\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\n\nSee also[edit]"},{"id":"1060","name":"World Rally Championship","year":"2001","genre":"Racing, Sport","rating_ign":"70","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co7k63.jpg","description":"The first official FIA licensed World Rally Chamionship game in the series for the PlayStation 2 using official drivers, cars and tracks from the 2001 season."},{"id":"1061","name":"WRC II Extreme","year":"2002","genre":"Racing, Sport","rating_ign":"78","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co48x0.jpg","description":"WRC II Extreme is a 2002 off-road video game released for the PlayStation 2.

These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air.

As the story develops, more is revealed about Jen's past and her relationship with her boyfriend, as well as the nature of the demon worlds.\n\nIn Primal, the player can control either Jen or Scree as they navigate the realms of Oblivion. As the game progresses, newer demonic forms are obtained, which prove invaluable in solving various puzzles and combat.\n\nControl can be switched between Jen and Scree at any time in game. When in control of one, the other will be operated by AI, performing various functions depending on the situation. During play, the characters can interact with one another, performing actions such as asking questions, or siphoning energy.\n\nWhen in control of Jen, the player may transform into one of four demonic forms for various purposes, depending on the situation (provided the forms are unlocked). When in a demon form, Jen experiences a boost in attack, defense, speed, attack range and access to abilities unavailable in a human form. The tattoo on Jen's back also glows when in a demon form, corresponding to various forms.\n\nDefeating enemies involves weakening enemies to the point where their hit points reach zero, at which time a finishing move must be performed to kill the enemy. While the moves differ in style and time taken, the final effect remains the same. Enemies can be finished off before the health bar reaches zero, and doing so leaves more residual energy.\n\nWhile Jen can remain in a demonic form indefinitely, taking damage will reduce health. However, hit points here are represented by demonic energy. When an enemy is killed, the remaining energy can be drained through use of Scree, who can store the energy for when it is needed. Jen can then call on the energy, siphoning it off to replenish her own. Scree can store a vast amount of energy, but also has limits as to how much.\n\nWhen in control of Scree, the player is invulnerable; Scree, being a gargoyle, cannot suffer damage, making him an effective scout. Scree is capable of climbing on stone walls, a necessary ability when traversing the realms. Scree can also store drained energy from dead enemies, which can be used to replenish Jen's demonic health, though he must remain immobile when doing so.\n\nScree is revealed to be the long-lost Abdizur, who disappeared following an encounter with the lord of Chaos. In Solus, for a temporary amount of time, the player possesses a life-size statue of Abdizur via Scree, to combat Belhazur when Jen's powers are not fit to do so. The player may also possess other statues in an area under given circumstances.\n\nThe player may also happen across various energy crystals, which can be stored and used if Scree's energy reserves are not enough and the player is at low health. These crystals are kept throughout the game, the only exclusion being when revisiting previous scenes, at which point they are reduced to a default amount. This means that the crystals function as extra lives, to a degree.\n\nIf Jen is in human form, her health replenishes automatically if she is not in battle (human form only; demon energy must be replenished by either drawing on Scree's reserve energy or, failing that, by using a crystal). While in human form, Jen's health represents her presence in the demon world. If she loses all her health while in human form, she is returned to the human world, where she is in a near-death state. When this happens, the player must direct Scree to the nearest rift gate within a time limit (not seen on screen, though the voice of Arella warns the player that time is running out). If Scree does not reach a rift gate in time, Jen dies, and the game is over.\n\nThroughout the game, constant saving can prove onerous, particularly if the player wishes to backtrack and revisit certain areas. Provided a save game is present, the player may do so, and can revisit nearly all of the locations, once they have been unlocked via an in-game cutscene."},{"id":"1154","name":"Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria","year":"2006","genre":"Role-playing (RPG)","rating_ign":"79","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1onn.jpg","description":"Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is the second installment of the Valkyrie Profile series.\nTaking place hundreds of years before the original game, the story revolves around two characters living the same body, named Silmeria and Alicia.

On August 3, 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to the island was lost. During the subsequent blackout, all of the islanders disappeared and the island became deserted. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a magazine editor called Mamoru Itsuki is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes, after it is hit by a red tidal wave. Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's \"monsters\", the shibito.\n\nThe game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past.

The game was followed by a PlayStation 2 sequel, a reimagining for the PlayStation 3 and a film adaption.\n\nSiren is divided into stages, each taking place in one of ten areas in the village of Hanuda, and organized chronologically in a table called the \"Link Navigator\". In order to complete a stage, the player must accomplish a primary objective that usually involves reaching an exit point, subduing undead enemies called \"Shibito\", or finding an item. Objectives in different stages are interconnected via a butterfly effect, and a character's actions in one stage can trigger a secondary objective in another stage.\n\nThere are miscellaneous items scattered throughout each stage that give the player further insight into the plot's background. Once obtained, these items are archived in a catalog and can be viewed at any time during the game's duration. The game's player characters possess a psychic power named \"sightjack,\" which enables them to see and hear what a nearby Shibito or human sees and hears, and thus pinpoint its position, as well as gain knowledge of their activities and of the position of obtainable items. The clarity of each target depends on the distance from the player character. Once a point of view is located, it can be assigned to one of certain buttons of the controller to easily switch between multiple points of view. However, the player character is unable to move during use of the ability and is thus vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe game encourages the player to avoid Shibito rather than fight them. Characters can walk silently, avoid the use of a flashlight, and crouch behind objects to elude detection. Certain mission objectives require the player character to use items and/or the environment to distract Shibito from their activity, in order for them to achieve a goal. Others require the player to escort a non-player character. Player characters can also shout at any time in order to get the attention of nearby Shibito. Within most stages, the player character can hide in certain places such as cupboards and lock doors to prevent Shibito from entering. When a Shibito hears a sound made by the player character, it will search in the direction from which they heard the sound. If a character is seen by a Shibito, the latter will pursue the character to kill them either with a melee or ranged weapon or by strangulation. The Shibito will also shout to alert other nearby Shibito. Once the character has remained out of the Shibito's sight for a period of time, the Shibito will give up and resume its usual habits. Weapons are available for the player throughout the game, ranging from melee weapons to firearms. While Shibito can be knocked out in combat, they cannot be killed and will reanimate after a short period of time. If a character is injured, they can recover after some time has passed. Characters will lose stamina during combat and while running."},{"id":"1174","name":"Street Fighter Alpha Anthology","year":"2006","genre":"Fighting, Arcade","rating_ign":"81","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co6cdy.jpg","description":"Street Fighter Alpha Anthology is a compilation that collects the Street Fighter Alpha series with a remixed version of the console-exclusive Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold and Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix.

Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\n\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm.

The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge."},{"id":"1449","name":"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix","year":"2006","genre":"Racing","rating_ign":"71","photo_url":"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co1hgi.jpg","description":"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition is a racing game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games It is the third installment in the Midnight Club series.

The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an in-game thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details.
